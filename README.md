## 👋 Introduction

This repository contains a curated collection of references related to large language models used during my thesis research at University of Birmingham. These references include academic papers, blog posts, articles, and other pertinent resources. The goal is to provide a comprehensive list for anyone interested in the intersection of LLM evaluation, or just language models in general.

## 🔍 How to Use This Repository

## 📝 References

**Important Note**: The below summarisations of references were created as a project for testing the text summarisation capabilities of multiple large language models for high efficacy against minimal token input. While all summarisations scored contextually embedded harmonic means (BERTScore) above 0.91, some errors may exist. Please use this repository of academic writings cautiously.
